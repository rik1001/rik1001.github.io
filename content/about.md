Welcome to Astralis, a place to talk about science, psychology, subconscious, and beyond.

## Who am I?

Hello, I am Rik, I am nothing but some cosmic dust who just happens to have gained consciousness.
Aside from being some conscious cosmic dust, I am a student, a learner, someone who is passionate about space, time, humans and their brains, and beyond. There are a lot of things that interests me, these are just a few to mention. Dive with me into the vast ocean of knowledge to unlock the secrets that lies beyond our apparent vision.

## The Mission of Astralis

Astralis exists to be your gateway drug for entering into a zone of thoughts and ideas that can only be limited by your imagination. Every post that I upload, every exploration that I travel, every moment spent here is designed to spark that beautiful feeling of intellectual curiosity.
Whether you're a fellow traveler in the realms of science, a student of the human condition, or simply someone who finds wonder in the complexity of existence, you've found your place. 

I research meticulously about a topic before I post here, the amount of time I spend writing and researching about topics will be worth it if you just visit my website and simply reflect and ponder on the topics.

## What Drives Me

My intellectual pursuits span across multiple dimensions of knowledge, each interconnected intricately in the grand web of reality:

**The Human Mind** - Exploring the intricate networks of neurons that create consciousness, emotion, and thought. Psychology and neuroscience reveal the beautiful complexity of what makes us fundamentally human.

**Medical Frontiers** - From anatomy to physiology, from the rhythm of the heart to the mysteries of cellular biology. Medicine represents the convergence of science and humanity's most essential needs.

**Scientific Wonder** - The relentless pursuit of understanding how our universe operates, from quantum mechanics to cosmic phenomena. Science is poetry written in the language of discovery and empirical truth.

**Beyond Conventional Boundaries** - Ideas that challenge the limits of confined thinking. Here, rigorous imagination meets methodical inquiry to explore the realm of possibility.
