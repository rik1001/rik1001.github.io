## Who am I?

Hello, I am Rik, I am nothing but some cosmic dust who just happens to have gained consciousness.
Aside from being some conscious cosmic dust, I am a student, a learner, someone who is passionate about space, time, humans and their brains, and beyond. There are a lot of things that interests me, these are just a few to mention. Dive with me into the vast ocean of knowledge to unlock the secrets that lies beyond our apparent vision.
